<h3 align="center">A Top-Down Action RPG in Godot</h3>

**Concept:**

This game is a captivating 2D Action RPG developed using the Godot game engine, drawing inspiration from classic Zelda titles like "A Link to the Past." In this unique take on the ARPG genre, players immerse themselves in a world where magic is the sole source of power. Guided by nostalgic influences, this game offers an engaging journey reminiscent of the olden era of gaming. Moreover, an additional layer of complexity is added by the fact that melee combat is not present, forcing the player to strategically keep their distance from enemies in the narrow corners of the dungeon they mysteriously wake up in.

**My Team:**

I created this game with some help from Nicholas Cirillo, another developer.

<br>

**My Roles in the process:**

* Design:

  * Game design
  
  * Level design
  
  * Enemy creation
  
  * Writing

* Development:

	* Lead developer
  
	* Game systems designer
  
	* Created most Nodes (Godot's prefabs) in the game

<br>

**Challenges:**

* Spellcasting system:

	* This was my first time using Godot, so getting used to the Particle and Physics systems took some time to get used to
 
	* Additionally, I was having trouble with spell collision, instance placement and inaccurate wand locations that took a lot of iteration, playtesting and debugging to fix

* Balancing combat difficulty:

	* Since ranged combat dominates the game, I had some difficulty making the simple enemies feel dangerous to the player. Thus, I added an enemy that fires spells, and another one that relentlessly charges at the player at high speed. I also made the setting of the game a dungeon with narrow corners and multiple surprise attacks, in order to increase the sense of danger 

 	* After that, the game actually became too difficult, so I had to move some enemies aside and reduce aggro range so that the Player isn't surrounded so easily, allowing for a more gradual increase in difficulty for the first Level

**Assets:**

* None of the team members are artists, so we decided to use an existing [asset pack](https://pixel-boy.itch.io/ninja-adventure-asset-pack) for the sprites and tilesets (licensed under the CC0 license)

* The particle effects were all created by me
