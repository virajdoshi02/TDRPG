<h3 align="center">A Top-Down Action RPG in Godot</h3>

(add image here)

**Concept:**

This game is a captivating 2D Action RPG developed using the Godot game engine, drawing inspiration from classic Zelda titles like "A Link to the Past." In this unique take on the ARPG genre, players immerse themselves in a world where magic is the sole source of power. Guided by nostalgic influences, this game offers an engaging journey reminiscent of the olden era of gaming. Moreover, an additional layer of complexity is added by the fact that melee combat is not present, forcing the player to strategically keep their distance from enemies in the narrow corners of the dungeon they mysteriously wake up in.
